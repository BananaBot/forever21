				<h1>Dorian Gray and Drug Lord Henry</h1>
			</div>
		</div>
		<p><u>The Picture of Dorian Gray</u>, a novel by Oscar Wilde, depicts the psychological state of a young individual living in the Victorian era as he falls under the influence of a character whose morals are unclear, as well as his demise. It elaborates on the effect of being in the company of a bad crowd, along with just how easily someone can be swayed if another person uses the right methods. Dorian begins to see life as Lord Henry does, as a succession of pleasures in which questions of good and evil are irrelevant. To this extent, Lord Henry’s ideas of youth, beauty, and hedonism resemble drugs, while Dorian is the addict. He just can’t get enough of it. In this way, in our story line, we projected Dorian as a very innocent college boy, just having had entered the “real world” and very very influential; as most young people are. What leads to his downfall however is mostly due to his bad environment and immoral company, all teaching him to value superficial things, or value things with no meaning (art for art’s sake). Like how in the novel, the societal obsession with the Aesthetic Movement partakes in Dorian’s corruption.</p> 
		<p style="margin-bottom: 100px;">The choose your own adventure page serves to prove the point how Dorian did have a choice in life and that his downfall is a direct result of his own actions. Yet, the further you get in the story line and the more events that occur, slowly you begin realize there are no other options and that the choices you make don’t matter anymore because you’re too deep in Hedonism, and there’s no erasing your sins. Thus this is the consequences you must face after having gotten to escape them for so long. This serves to show that Dorian, even if he wanted to become a better person, could not because of all the forces that were acting upon him - Basil’s idolatry, society’s indifference, Lord Henry’s poisonous words, and his own narcissism. As the adventure proceeds, and the more sins he commits, we see Dorian being more callous and indifferent in the way he says things, and near the end of the adventure he almost sounds insane. This is to show his gradual diminish of humanity, and overall gradual spiral downhill into the depths of no return.</p>
